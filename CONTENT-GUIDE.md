# AutoDeal — Content Management Guide

Welcome to your AutoDeal website! This guide explains how to add and manage content.

---

## Quick Overview

Your website content is stored as Markdown files in the `src/content/` folder:

```
src/content/
├── vehicles/     ← Car listings
├── blog/         ← Blog posts
└── countries/    ← Export destination pages
```

You have two options for managing content:
1. **Decap CMS** — Visual editor at `/admin` (recommended for non-technical users)
2. **Markdown files** — Edit files directly in the `src/content/` folder

## After Making Changes

### If using Decap CMS:
Changes are saved automatically to your GitHub repository. The site rebuilds and deploys within 1-2 minutes.

### If editing files directly:
1. Save your changes
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new vehicle listing"
   git push
   ```
3. Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy (1-2 minutes)

### Local Development
To test changes locally before deploying:
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server at localhost:4321
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview the production build
```

## Important Notes

- **Slug must be unique** — no two items can have the same slug
- **Images** — upload to `public/images/` and reference as `/images/filename.jpg`
- **Drafts** — blog posts with `draft: true` won't appear on the live site
- **Featured vehicles** — toggle `featured: true` to display on the homepage
- **Categories** — use one of the five predefined categories for blog posts
- **Date format** — use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2026-05-12)
